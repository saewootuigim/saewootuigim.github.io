I took this photo at Angel's Landing at Zion National Park in December 2014. I know I should have a look to my left or the person who took this picture should have moved to his left a little more, but, oh well.

Anyway, I am thinking of removing this page. This whole website is about myself and why do I need an additional dedicated page to describe myself again? Let me decide before this year-end comes.
